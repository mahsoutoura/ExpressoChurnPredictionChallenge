# ExpressoChurnPredictionChallenge

"Expresso is an African telecommunications company that provides customers with airtime and mobile data bundles. The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of each Expresso customer “churning,” i.e. becoming inactive and not making any transactions for 90 days.


The evaluation metric for this challenge is Area Under the Curve (AUC).

The values can be between 0 and 1, inclusive. Where 1 indicates the customer churned and 0 indicates the customer stayed with Expresso." zindi.africa
